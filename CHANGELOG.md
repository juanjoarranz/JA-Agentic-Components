### 📚 docs: Updated README image display width

Expanded the architecture image width in README.md from 60% to 100% so the visual overview is easier to read without zooming. This change improves documentation usability by making key structure details immediately visible across typical desktop viewports. The update is presentation-only and does not alter repository behavior, build steps, or skill execution logic.

### 🔧 chore: Initialized repository baseline

Established the first project snapshot to define the repository as the source of truth for reusable agentic components, including skills, documentation, and workspace conventions. Added foundational documentation and licensing assets so contributors can onboard quickly, understand expected structure, and follow consistent operational patterns from the beginning. This baseline reduces setup ambiguity and creates a stable starting point for iterative additions of skills, custom agents, hooks, and orchestration resources.
