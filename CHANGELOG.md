### 🔧 chore: Initialized repository baseline

Established the first project snapshot to define the repository as the source of truth for reusable agentic components, including skills, documentation, and workspace conventions. Added foundational documentation and licensing assets so contributors can onboard quickly, understand expected structure, and follow consistent operational patterns from the beginning. This baseline reduces setup ambiguity and creates a stable starting point for iterative additions of skills, custom agents, hooks, and orchestration resources.
